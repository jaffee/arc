Arc (from ARChive) is a program for getting things out of your way
that you don't want to delete. It takes files that you specify on the
command line and moves them under the archive-dir, mirroring their
original location in your filesystem. Ex:

My archive-dir is /home/me/.archives/ and I'm working in /home/me/projects/
I run:
$ arc project1.py sometempfile

Those two files will be moved to
/home/me/.archives/home/me/projects/project1.py and
/home/me/.archives/home/me/projects/sometempfile

Usage:
  arc <file>... [options]

Options:
  -a DIR,  --archive-dir DIR   Specifies the directory to which files will be archived. [default: ~/.archives]
